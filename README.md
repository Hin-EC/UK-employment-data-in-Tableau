# UK-Employment-Data-in-Tableau

This project focuses on **visualizing UK employment data** using **Tableau Public**. The dashboard provides insights into **employment trends across cities, industries, and sub-industries**, along with an interactive filter for cities.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created the following **visualizations** in Tableau Public:

- **Average % Change by City (Map)**: Displays employment percentage changes across UK cities.
- **Top 10 Sub-Industries (Treemap)**: Highlights the top 10 sub-industries based on employment data.
- **Top 10 Industries (Column Chart)**: Shows the leading 10 industries by employment figures.

Additionally, an **interactive city filter** allows users to focus on specific locations.

## Visualizations

### 1. **Average % Change by City (Map)**
- Visualizes the average percentage change in employment across different UK cities.
- Helps identify areas with significant employment growth or decline.

### 2. **Top 10 Sub-Industries (Treemap)**
- Displays the top 10 sub-industries based on employment data.
- Uses color and size to represent employment distribution.

### 3. **Top 10 Industries (Column Chart)**
- Ranks the top 10 industries with the highest employment figures.
- Helps compare employment distribution across major industries.
